# Unity Traffic Simulator

This project is a traffic simulator developed in Unity, using C# for the programming logic. The simulator features traffic light-controlled intersections that change according to a timer, allowing vehicles to pass in an orderly fashion and simulating real-life traffic flow.

## Features

- **Automated Traffic Lights:** Traffic lights change automatically based on configurable timers, managing traffic flow at various intersections.
- **Vehicle Simulation:** Vehicles react to traffic light changes, stopping or moving according to the signals.
- **Realistic Interaction:** Interaction between vehicles and traffic signals mimics realistic traffic patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Used for all the graphical interface and physical simulation.
- **C#**: Programming language used to write the game logic and control the simulation elements.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Unity installed on your computer. Follow these steps to start the simulation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rcarlosjorge/Simulador2D.git
# Open Unity Hub and select 'Open'.
# Navigate to the project directory and open it
